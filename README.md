# BOG_Anomaly-Detection

**Summary:**

As a graduate data science consultant working for Blue Ocean Gear Company (a company that create high-tech buoys that can track gear in the marine environment), the goal of this project is to predict the locations of drifting buoys to ensure faster recovery of lost gear and conduct anomaly detection on the movement of buoy sensors. I started with the descriptive analysis to impute missing values, identify outliers and  conduct feature engineering. In order to obtain more trajectory data for each of our clientsâ€™ buoys, I ran thousands of simulations of secured buoys to generate synthetic data using OceanParcels. Then I used simulation data to train random forests (as a baseline model), and further improved the model performance using LSTM neural network, and then fine-tune models on actual Buoy trajectory data  (generate prediction interval where buoys may be located) . After prediction buoy locations using LSTM, I extracted relevant features from the residuals for anomaly detection (buoys typically move in a circular motion, but sometimes they drift). I applied PCA to the standardized features and apply K-Means clustering to identify potential outliers.
